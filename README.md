# People Face Identification and Recognition Algorithm Sample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.3.

# Add your COSMOS API Keys
Find the file 'COSMOS-Accelerators-Facial-Recognition / src / app / services / cognitive-api.service.ts ' and add your own COSMOS API keys.

## Environment Setup

Before you get started with this project, make sure your environment is good to go.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Install the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
4. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

NOTE: On Windows 10--with `npm` or `git` you may have to update your Environment Variables for the command line to know where they were installed.

## Getting Started

Now that you have your environment set up, you can finally start working with the sample code.

1. `git clone https://github.com/cosmos-cognitive-cloud/COSMOS-Accelerators-Facial-Recognition`
2. Right click the project directory -> select `Open with Code`
3. Ctrl + Shift + ` to open a terminal window
4. Type `npm install` to download the project's packages
5. Type `ng serve` to run the application via `http://localhost:4200/`.  The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
6. Success!  You should see a working demo of the People Face Identification and Recognition Algorithm built on Angular.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
